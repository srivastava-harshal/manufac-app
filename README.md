## Description

- Responsive react app for plotting scatter and bar chart using [echarts](https://git.hust.cc/echarts-for-react/)
- Created a service that can take in any kind of data and render charts based on it
- It is scalable and proper file structure is followed so that more charts can be added easily without modifying the existing code

(Screenshots are provided below!)

I am still learning TypeScript and wasn't completely confident in using it for this assignment, so I used JavaScript instead.
